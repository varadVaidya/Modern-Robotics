# Modern Robotics
This repository is to show some of the work done I did in the Coursera specialization Modern Robotics
No code is added to the Git to honour the Cousera Code of Honour of not sharing the assignment code, especially as these assignments are Peer Graded.

## Course 2
This assignment involved to use the Inverse Kinematics alogrithm to find out the joint position required to achieve a desired configration and then animate it using V-Rep.

## Course 3
This assignment used the concept of Dynamics of Open Chains to simulate a robot arm freely falling in graviy. And intersting case occurs in the second simulation beacuse the initial joint angles are such that the robot acts like a double pendulum and follows a chaotic dynamics. The forward and inverse dynamics are implemented in Python and simulated in V-Rep.
